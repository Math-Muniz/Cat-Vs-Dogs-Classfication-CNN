# Cat Vs Dog Image Classification - CNN Project 

## Introduction

This is a machine learning project that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The notebook includes sections for data preparation, model building, and evaluation. It uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries. It also includes a dataset of cat and dog images. The purpose of the notebook is to classify the cat and dog images and predict which images are cats and which images are dogs. I uploaded in this repository the photos I used for prediction.
